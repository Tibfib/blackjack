A simple blackjack app built with React.

Deployed here: http://will-honey-blackjack.surge.sh/

Some notes:
- Made in ~3.5 hours
- Game ending/restart is not implemented (it'll error when you run out of cards)
- I left the styles for last and as a result they are pretty nonexistant. 
- I compute the card scores a lot. I probably should have just stored them in state. oh well.
